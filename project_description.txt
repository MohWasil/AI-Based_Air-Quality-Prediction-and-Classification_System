Hi Everyone

please check out the project and if you have any questions just ask me anytime and i'll try to fix them in your satisfaction.


first of all when you open the project try to run
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

commands to save some unsaved models to database

admin username and password
email: suhailsammim32@gmail.com
passoword: suhail123


i think most of the project parts are done and is ready for production to some extent
most of the backend parts are complete but about the
connection to frontend some of them are not connected like plotly
you can do this via ajax method using fetch method to connect to api of the
backend and get that data and bring them to frontend

i am running out of time these days
i should really say sorry in this part, i could do it in future days (i mean these connections and ....)
but i do know that you are reaching the deadline and that would be too late so i just leave them to you dudes üòå


This project is an api based project and there is an app named ui that contains frontend files and
overall project overview
there is 5 apps in this project

1- Accounts:
there is defined three types of accounts there:
  Individual Account
  Organizational Account
  Admin Account

also apis for making new accounts through form ajax api calls that are in frontend


2- dashboard:

this app is to control the admin site and can only be accessed
through admin access
you should login with email, passoword
email: suhailsammim32@gmail.com
password: suhail123

this is the admin account which by this you can access full to website including Individual and Organizational predictions
some parts are done by backend like stats (number of Individual users, Organizational users, number of followers)
and can be accessed through frontend by an api call

3- feedbacks:

this app is about getting feedbacks from users that includes (Individual idead, Organizational ideas, questions, contacts)


4- predict:

this part is all about predictions and ML models it maybe there that some parts are left
the csv data is stored in db about the all countries predictions i put that in no use
the prediction is done throught api call you can access the data in a format like this
when you call the api "/api/predict/predict/" via post method and passing four inputs of (country, state, latitude, and longitude)
which is done in location.js static file
it will give you a json format like this:

{
    "state": "kabul",
    "latitude": 12.232,
    "longitude": 34.123,
    "classification_result": "Fair",
    "feature_importance": [('o2', 32), ('nh3', 23)......],
    "predic_res": [('1H', 'Fair'), ('2H', 'Moderate')], ---> Ask Wasil jan for more accurate information and format about the ML Model
    "advice_message": ['keep yourself safe', 'put on mask', 'don't ride bicycle'], ---> (the gpt advice in such format)
  }

this information can be get throught api call but unfortunately
I can not connect them to frontend to plotly.js and graphs,
I count you on this dudes üê±

and also in frontend in Individual-use
there is a table that shows the amount of co2,
or other features of future like 2 hours later, 4 hours later
but there is no such thing in ML model
the model shows the feature_importance of the now time
and for the future times in only outputs the Air Quality Index
(talk to Wasil more about this)

5- ui:
this app is all about ui and frontend files, .......



THIS WAS THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT I KNOW THERE ARE SOME PARTS LEFT BUT I THINK IT IS READY TO GO ON PRODUCTION FOR TEST
