# 🌍💨 AI Driven Air-Quality-Prediction-and-Classification monitor system 📊🌱
This project develops a real-time air quality prediction and classification system that collects historical and real-time data from the `NEPA` and `OpenWeather API`. The data is preprocessed with techniques like outlier correction and feature engineering, and then analyzed using machine learning models `(Random Forest, XGBoost)` for classification and deep learning models `(LSTM, TSMixer)` for pollutant concentration forecasting. Hyperparameter tuning and explainable AI techniques like `SHAP` and `LIME` are used to improve model performance and interpretability. The system is deployed in a real-time environment, with a web application for visualizing air quality data and mobile-based alerts to keep users informed of air quality changes.

**🔧 Project Consist of these steps: 📝** <br>
  **1. 📊 Data Collection:**
  Data is been collected from NEPA (National Environmental Protection Agency) of Afghanistan & OpenWeather for ten days.

  **2. 🧹 Data Preprocessing:**
  * For this project Advance Preprocessing methods are used such as using **FTLRI** & **KNN** for imputation.
  * **K-means clustring** to cluster the locations.
  * **Lag & Rolling** for making history the dataset. and other methods.

 **3. 🤖 Models Used:**
 Different models were tested such as XGBoost, LSTM and many others but selected for the project is RandomForest for classification and TSMixer for Regression. 
 

## Getting Started 🚀

You can set up and run this project in two ways:  
- **Clone the repository directly**
- **Download and install dependencies manually**

---

### 1. Clone the Repository Directly 🧑‍💻

If you want to clone the project and install dependencies in one go, follow these steps:

#### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohWasil/AI-Based_Air-Quality-Prediction-and-Classification_System.git
```


#### Navigate into the project directory
`cd your-directory`

#### Create a virtual environment (optional)
##### For Mac
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
##### On Windows <br>
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
#### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
--- 

### 2. Download and Install Dependencies Manually 📥

Alternatively, you can download the project as a ZIP file and install the dependencies manually:  
  1. Click the **Code** button on GitHub and select **Download ZIP**.  
  2. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location.  
  3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the extracted folder.  
  4. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:  
  #### Navigate into the project directory
  `cd your-extracted-folder`
  #### Mac and Linux
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv/bin/activate 
  ```
  #### Windows
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
#### Install dependencies:
  ```bash 
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 3. Set up API Keys 🔑
Before running the server, you need to configure your API keys in the .env file. This file can be found in the `predict/MLAutomation` directory.<br>
You will need three API keys:
- **OpenAI API Key**
- **OpenWeather API Key**
- **TimeZone API Key** <br>
You can obtain the necessary API keys from the following websites:<br>
- [OpenAI Website](https://openai.com/)<br>
- [OpenWeather Website](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution)<br>
- [TimeZone Website](https://timezonedb.com/)<br>

---

### 4. Database Setup 🗄️
After installing the dependencies and setting up your API keys, follow these steps:
#### 1. Makemigrations.
Use this command in your project directory to create database migrations: <br>
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```
#### 2. Migrate.
Now, migrate the database to apply the changes: <br>
```
python manage.py migrate
```
#### 3. Run The suerver.
Use this command to run the server locally: <br>
```
python manage.py runserver
```
Now, your server should be running locally and you can access the application!

## Troubleshooting ❓
- If you encounter any issues during setup, ensure that you’ve installed all dependencies correctly.
- Verify that the API keys are entered correctly in the .env file.
